[Description]
Mod-EN=One of the things many find sorely lacking in the Bioware NPCs are the more complex relationships presented by modern NPC mods--especially in regards to "friendships," the relationships NPCs have with the PC when not romancing them.||This mod adds a series of dialogues with Sarevok, the protagonists Bhaalspawn half-brother, expanding on his character and story, which feature throughout Throne of Bhaal.
