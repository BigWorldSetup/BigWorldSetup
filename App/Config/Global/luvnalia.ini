[Description]
Mod-EN=Contains a complete romance with Nalia, including the tree of life dialogs, beloved one in danger, Nalia's abduction by Bodhi, and other love related quests. It also adds some new quests and character interactions. We strongly recommend having Minsc in the party. The mod hangs after the wedding because of faulty programming.
