[Description]
Mod-EN=You will be asked to investigate why a village just south of Athkatla is being deserted by its inhabitants. This large mod centers around five completely new major areas throughout BG2, and has a long, non-linear storyline and a handful of smaller fedex quests. It is designed for characters at midlevel (eleven and above).
