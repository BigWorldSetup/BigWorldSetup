[Description]
Mod-EN=This mod will introduce two fighter kits Jedi and Sith, who are from Star Wars, into your game.|The Jedi are well known for their talent in manipulating The Force. Their Force powers can penetrate magic resistance. The Jedi are good at fighting with lightsabers, but can not fight in armors.|The Sith are much like the Jedi, except for they believe in the dark side of The Force while the Jedi believe in the light side of The Force.
