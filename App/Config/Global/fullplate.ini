[Description]
Mod-EN=This mod is one big rework of the armour system of BG2 and IWD. Light, enchanted armours actually help you dodge. Heavy, enchanted armours don't help dodging much, but they absorb perhaps half or more of an blow in exchange for slowing you down and fatiguing you. |Stealth, thieving and casting in heavy armour is possible, but difficult.||Warning! This mod needs to be downloaded manually.
