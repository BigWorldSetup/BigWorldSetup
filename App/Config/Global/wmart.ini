[Description]
Mod-EN=Deidre and Joluv, the bonus merchants from the second part of the series, make a stop in Baldur's Gate before they head to Amn. These merchants bring along their treasure trove of goods from the far off places they have visited. Their items are exotic, magical, expensive and likely overpowered.
