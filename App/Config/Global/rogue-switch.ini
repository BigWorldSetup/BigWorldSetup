[Description]
Mod-EN=This mod contains two interconvertible kits: the "Bardic Switch" and the "Thief Switch". When you choose one of these Switch kits from the character generation screen, you gain innate abilities that let you switch into another kit and perform its respective abilities in that form. If you want to switch back, you will have to activate the innate ability again of that particular class.
