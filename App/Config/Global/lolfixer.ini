[Description]
Mod-EN=Majestic fixer for almost everything that bothers your game. These are pure fixes that will never remove content that otherwise would be available. Tweak components are optional. This mod's Creature Inventory Overhauler component and Miloch's Creature Fixer mod both solve the same problem (the game crashes when creatures have invalid item combinations equipped, for example a 2H sword with a shield at the same time), but Miloch's Creature Fixer deletes such items while the Overhauler moves such items to inventory so no content is lost. Either solution works, so you may choose which one you prefer.
