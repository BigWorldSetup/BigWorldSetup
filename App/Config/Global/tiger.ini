[Description]
Mod-EN=The monk masters a style that concentrates on unleashing the fierceness of the fighter in a nearly uncontrolled fashion by using the monks Chi. The wisdom required to master Chi to this high of a level reduces the monks overall physical prowess, which he more than makes up for with his spell-like abilities. It is also the only martial arts style in the Relams that actively makes use of weapons in its training, so he can gain grand mastery in quarterstaffs.||Warning!
