[Description]
Mod-EN=Margarita is a young halfling that seems to be traveling the Sword Coast, although it is obvious she isn't quite from around there. She's defensive, quiet, and prone to sarcasm when pushed or confronted. She likes to come off as useless, timid, or otherwise innocent, even if that isn't quite the case. Her main belief is: Honor Thy Employer. She does whatever is in her power to complete her employer's tasks, asks no questions except: "How much will I be paid." She is intelligent enough however to see if her life is endangered, and will not endanger it if she can help it (At this case, the price becomes too high).||Warning!
