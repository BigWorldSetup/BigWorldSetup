; ### Backup ###
[BA-Au3CleanInst]
L1=Backup:|It seems the "BiG World Setup" is running for the first time.|It is recommended that you create a backup of your clean patched and once-started %s installation, so you don't have to completely reinstall the original game again the next time you want to use BWS. All you need is around 500 MB of free disk-space.||Do you want to do that?
L2=You chose to create a backup.|Please remember that a clean patched and once-started %s installation without any additional files and around 500 MB of free disk-space is needed.||Should the backup be created now?

L20=This will affect all files that were created after the backup.||Should these files be deleted or moved?
L21=Attention: According to your WeiDU.log, mods have been installed already.|You have not made a backup with BWS, therefore you must completely install "%s" anew.
L22=Attention: According to your WeiDU.log, mods have been installed already.|You have made a backup with BWS. In this situation, another backup normally does not make sense. If it does, your next step should be to restore your backup.
L23=Your old files were moved to %s.
L24=does not exist.
H1=BACKUP STORE/RESTORE|||What's done:|You are starting your first installation or want to make a manual backup of the %s files. All files are copied except those that aren't modified (from CD or data-folder) or aren't needed for gaming (e.g. cache-files).||It is assumed that you are doing this after you set up a clean installation, patched it, and started it. After you made this backup, you will not have to reinstall the game again, so you don't have to worry about errors during the installation. You can always roll back a backup quickly.||If you do a restore of the files, you will lose all the changes that were made after the backup.|The bif-files from the data-folder as files needed for the installation of mods are deleted and the saved files are restored to the gaming folder. Directories that contain the downloads, portraits, saved data or the BWS itself are not affected.|||Interaction:|You will need to answer questions from the "BiG World Setup" to get the expected results.|E.g. you will be asked if you want to create a backup or not, delete or keep those that did not exist during the creation of the backup and so on.||If any input is needed, there will be question and a line with the expected input-values.|If you enter anything wrong, it will not be accepted and the expected values will be shown again.|||Debug:|This button will open the log-file with the current output.|You can find all the logs in the directory of the same name. Each process has its own log.|||Exit:|If you want to close this window, you will have to wait for the backup or restore to end. This may take a few minutes.||This is absolute necessary, because you would have a damaged backup or installation if the restoration is not done completely.||If no files are moved or deleted any more, the window will be closed directly.

H1=CREATE OWN BiG World INSTANCE|||What's done:|It is assumed that you do this after you set up a clean installation, patched and started it. A copy of the %s installation is created. The big additional folder with the files from the CDs are left out, though. By an adjustment to the %s.ini, the game is going to fetch this data from the "original" folder. This way, you can still play the original game and multiple additional instances. This will take about 1.2 GB of disk-space.||If you do not start modding the original game, you will not need to install the game again. The modded game is clearly separated from the original one and you can simply delete the "BiG World"-instance, if you don't need it any more.|||Interaction:|You will need to answer questions from the "BiG World Setup" to get the expected results.|E.g. you will be asked if you want to create a link on your desktop or not.||If any input is needed, there will be question and a line with the expected input-values.|If you entered anything wrong, it will not be accepted and the expected values will be shown again.|||Debug:|This button will open the log-file with the current output.|You can find all the logs in the directory of the same name. Each process has its own.|||Exit:|If you want to close this window, you will have to wait until the instance is created. This may take a few minutes.||This is absolute necessary, because you would have a damaged one if the copying-process would be interrupted.||If no files are moved or deleted any more, the window will be closed directly.

H1=EXTRACTION TEST|||What's done:|All the mods that were selected in the main window and were downloaded are tested to make sure you won't be missing files later.||Each mod always consists of a core- and may have an additional- and/or a language-archive. If an error was reported during the extraction-process, you will be asked if you want to test, provide or skip them. The mods integrity will be verified during the test. This can take a while but give you a clue if the file should be downloaded again.||That download can be initiated with your default web browser using the provide-option. You don't have to know the link, the "BiG World Setup" will open it for you to guide you through this process.|You have to extract the archive into your %s-folder afterward.|If the download seems to be alright, you can extract it with your default packager-program.|If you select that, the "BiG World Setup" will open those archives or start self-extracting mods. For those ones, please make sure to close the WeiDU-process that will show up after the extraction. An installation has to be avoided now.||You may also choose to remove the missing mods if they are not essential.||When the extraction of the archives is done, the program should recognize the missing pieces and continue with the installation. If that's not the case, please heed the following:||You can close and restart this test as many times as you like.|The files have to unpacked in that manner, that a setup (a WeiDU-executable) can be found in the %s-folder. If it is located in a sub-folder, move its content from the sub-folder into the %s-folder.|There can be archives in an archive. Look if you have to extract another file.|The content-packages for InfinityAnimatation have to be extracted into the InfinityAnimation\Content-directory, the Restore-package goes into InfinityAnimation\Restore. You have to extract these files without the file-path.|||Interaction:|You will need to answer questions from the "BiG World Setup" to get the expected results.|E.g. you will be asked if you want to extract missing mods yourself or skip this step and remove them from further actions and the installation itself.|If any input is needed, there will be a question and a line with the expected input-values.||If you entered anything wrong, it will not be accepted and the expected values will be shown again.|||Debug:|If you want to know what happened during the extraction process, you can check the output of the 7zip program.|In that case you will be able to open the log-file containing the complete output.||The easiest way to find them is to copy (parts) of the name of the mod and use the search function.||Please note that these may be huge and the editor may not respond for a few seconds.|You can find all the logs in the directory of the same name.|Each process has its own log.|||Exit:|If you want to close this window, you will have to wait until you can answer a question with x.|The reason for this is that the "BiG World Setup" is not looping here and it needs some answers, no matter what.||If you see an option to enter x to exit, pressing the button will work again.

As soon as you press the exit-button, the BiG World Setup waits until the current component is installed by the WeiDU setup.|If the software lasts a little longer, please leave it alone.|In general, you will be able to see some information for the installation, but not always. Then pay attention whether the hard disk is active, your CPU is claimed or changes are made to the Debug file. If all this is not the case, something could be stuck.||After the application was closed and you start it anew, you can choose to resume the installation from the point where you left it.

Each mod always consists of a core- and may have an additional- and/or a language-archive. The "BiG World Setup" looks for errors that were discovered during the download-process.|A missing file does not always mean that the link to file is broken. E.g. the BWS cannot load files from file-hosts that provide downloads only after you interacted with their website.||You will be asked if you want the BWS to run the download for the missing files again (useful if you had a connection problem) or provide them. Providing files can be done by initiating a download with your default web browser. You don't have to know the link, the "BiG World Setup" will open it for you to guide you through this process.|Your other choice is to select the file, which will open a file-selection-dialog. Browse your disk for the appropriate file and select it. You may also use this to force the BWS to use a file with a name or size that differs from the expected values.||You may also choose to remove these mods from further action if no essential mods are missing.|||Interaction:|You need to answer questions from the "BiG World Setup" to get the expected results.|E.g. you will be asked if you want to download missing mods yourself or skip this step and remove them from further actions and the installation itself.|If any input is needed, there will be question and a line with the expected input-values.||If you entered anything wrong, it will not be accepted and the expected values will be shown again.|||Debug:|If you want to know what happened during the extraction process, you may want to check the output of the wget program.|In that case you will be able to open the log-file containing the complete output.|The easiest way to find them is to copy (parts) of the name of the mod and use the search function.||You can find all the logs in the directory of the same name.|Each process has its own log.|||Exit:|If you want to close this window, you will have to wait until you can answer a question with x.

You can't deselect minimum mods, because you need them for a megamod installation.||Grey symbolizes Minimal selection|Green symbolizes Recommended selection|Blue symbolizes Maximized selection|Orange symbolizes Tactical selection|Red symbolizes Expert selection||The mod's translation is shown after its name. If you see a [--], this mod is not translated but does not add foreign text into the game. A good example would be a tweak.|An asterisk (*) at the end shows you that this mod is splitted and additional content (that does not fit here) can be found by using the context-menu.||Select a mod by mouse or keyboard to see its description. If you need extended information, click on the small button near the description.|||The context menu(right click):|In the first line you see the name of the component which you have chosen.||(Don't) pause before the component:|These lines allow you to stop the installation before the mod or the component. Thus you can look after the install or add mods that are still unknown to the Installer.||Visit the homepage:|If the address was provided for that mod, you can see further detailed information about the mod.||Show/Hide components:|Depending on the status of the element you can show or hide the components of the selected mod.||Jump to the next part of the mod:|If a mod is installed at different points, it is possible to jump to the next chapter which installs other components of the mods. Affected mods are marked with an asterisk (*).|||Options:|In the options-menu, there are several useful functions.||Click properties:|Adapts the behavior of the BiG World Setup with mod- and component-selection. If you click an item that does not fit your selection (e.g. a Tactical mod while you set the click property to Recommended), you will be asked if you still want to add it. If you select to always accept mods when you receive that prompt, the BiG World Setup will give you a short visual warning in the bottom box whenever you select a "non-fitting" mod.|If you don't want to have any prompts, just select Expert and there won't be any additional warnings nor inquiries since it includes all mods.|||Components indicate/hide: Shows you the individual components of the mods.||Sort in install-order/like the PDF:|Currently you can use a treeview to select mod types like npcs, quests or tweaks and access the related mods and components underneath. If you'd prefer to select your mods by going through the PDF guide and tweak the list to your liking, activate this option to get the mods and their components ordered as they are installed.||Administration:|Manage the mods URLs, descriptions and components.|||Reload selection: You can load a secured selection again and continue with the installation. You can also do that after a (broken off) installation to repair the last selection. Nevertheless, the export is the safer option.||Save selection: If want to take a break, you can secure your current selection. Close the application and reload them later.||Import selection from file: Load a selection from a selected file.||Export selection to file: Share your selection with other players. The selection is written in a chosen file, which you can e.g. give to your friends.||Import selection from WeiDU.log: Load a selection from a selected WeiDU.log.||If you load a saved selection (not just from a WeiDU.log), all components that are not found are marked as new afterwards. Since WeiDU does not log which mods or components you skipped, those skipped ones are also marked as new ones.|||Add: Adds all mods of a kind to your installation.||Remove: Remove all mods of a category.|You can thus add all NPCs or remove all quest-mods in one step.||Mark: All Mods of a category are marked with one click. Their components are shown automatically.|||Search:|If you would like to jump to a certain mod, you can use the search.

You can also change the size of the window to have more space.||A white coloured line represents a mod or component that is active in your selection. If multiple white lines appear together, they are all active and part of the same rule.||A red coloured line represents a conflict:  an active mod or component that conflicts with the white mods or components just above it.||An orange coloured line represents a missing dependency:  an inactive (not selected) mod or component that is needed by the white mods or components above it.||Some entries are marked with a double star (**). Those entries are rather a note of an inconsistency or a minor nuisance than a bug. You may choose to ignore those entries by right-clicking on the line.||If a plus sign appears before an orange coloured mod or component, only that specific mod or component can solve the dependency. Otherwise, you can choose from multiple mods or components to solve the dependency.||You can click on the lines to have the problem summarized in a sentence at the bottom of the list.||If you don't want to go into details, you can choose to solve all problems by clicking the buttons below the list. The actions taken when you click these buttons will be displayed to you and you can accept or decline the changes. Warning (**) rules will not be auto-solved (you must solve them by yourself).||To solve problems by yourself, right-click on a line. A context-menu will be shown. At the top will be the name of the mod you clicked (if you clicked a component, this will be shown under the mod name). Dependency problems are solved by either enabling the orange needed mod/component or disabling the white mod/component "in need". Conflicts can be handled by removing the selected component, all components that cause problems or the entire mod. You can also choose to do that in the opposite way.||After all problems are solved, the window will be closed.||Basis button:|Removes mods with open dependencies.||Conflicts button:|Removes conflicts.||Dependencies button:|Adds those mods and components that are needed to solve open dependencies.||Back button:|If you want to gather some information about the mods in the selection-screen first, you may return to the previous screen.||Continue button:|Removes conflicts and mods that have open dependencies.

Interact[14][9]=INSTALLATION DEFAULTS|||Program defaults:|In order to make the installation as pleasant and successful as possible, some settings can be changed here.||Here you can adjust how the BiG World Setup is to behave with the certain steps. For the download and unpacking one can either receive a warning about missing mods and try to repair the errors with the support by the program, force an additional pause after the download or the extraction so you can check some things yourself, or remove missing mods and those that dependent on them automatically. This is offered to ease an overnight installation.|If you have an existing collection of mods, the download can be skipped except for the subsequent file-check.|During the check you also can force the BWS to use existing files, so that you can test different mod-versions.||You can also choose to be notified of failed installations because of errors or not met dependencies. (The option "Report failed installation" includes them both.) Alternatively you can just omit the mod that failed to install. Additionally you can also pause on warnings.|Warnings are usually only interesting for debugging.||In all cases the installation is cancelled in the case of errors with critical mods.||Install in batches||The BiG World Setups can install all components of a mod at once or one by one. First one saves you a lot of time, second helps to recognize problems as early as possible.||All tests for warnings or errors will be made after the installation of these components, so you have to spend some more time after you ran into problems (de- and re-installation of successfully installed components).||Signal interruptions||If you want to leave your PC and do something else but want to know when some errors occur, turn on this option. It will play the ringing-sound that ships with windows to signalize the error acoustically. Ensure sound is enabled and not muted.|||Mod defaults:||Resolution|The widescreen-mod makes it possible to play the game in not intended resolutions. So one can get 16:10 now apart from high 4:3 resolutions. The current resolution is given as proposal.
