Don't exit the extract and download-tests if "not-mods" are missing (like weidu, fixpack). Set current folder for Au3SetFix to install Textharmonisation in correct folder. Set First Item before running Au3Install. Lots of small fixes for the Select.txt-file. A lot of small GUI-fixes. Check if widescreen-settings were complete to avoid crashes. Updated widescreen-stuff again.

Fixed: Smaller fixes: Removed additional line from scrolling text, fixed smaller issues with scrolling, fixed pause-glitches, text-generation in case of errors. Small stuff that halts the installation
Fixed: Single linkupdates test for existing update-files twice. It linkupdate may get blocked/computer be offline and update messes up the download of the mod.
20091120
Added: Check for conflicts
Added: RomanceCheats: Remove "Nothing kills romances?" - selection if "Allow multiple romances" was not selected before.
Added: Level1NPC: Remove "Restrict fighter/druids from armors single class druids cannot wear?" if Druid Remix will be installed.

Automatic search for diffs between all translations and available WeiDU-output.
Changed/Added: Complete rewrite of dependencies and conflict-system. Added and/or connections to have a more complex system then the old one.

20100204
Changed: Complete rewrite of testing for dependencies-checks during extraction/download or install-process.
Changed: Rewritten code for displaying the dependencies, moving mods from installable to not installable and moving the tp2-files itself. Enabled removing of components. Improved structure and documentation on that part.
Added: Don't allow extractions of empty save-file-names, which will result in an extraction of all files.
Fixed: Don't allow downloads of empty save-file-names, which will result in deleting all existing files in the download-folder.
Changed: Removed _Install_RemoveDependent in favor of _Depend_GetUnsolved.
Changed: Replaced _Install_TestInstallable with _Depend_ListConflicts and _Depend_ListUnsolved to adjust with new conflict/dependency-rules.
Fixed: Avoid moving files to another partition if old files are moved during a restore.
Added: Faster method to fetch the filename and the size from an url.
Changed: Rewritten steps for fetching information from url. Rewritten code that used its output.
Fixed: Fetching filesizes with wget will not loop infinitely and try to fetch the info in one try. Always search the first KB for an html-code if the filesize cannot be fetched.
Added: Select a sub-item if mod is fixed (BGT-GUI). Make item(s) of a fixed mod optional. The changed code includes a slight speedup during GUI-creation.
Added: Translate the theoretical component number of the BGT-GUI into the real one.
Fixed: Wrong display of "headline" for SUB/MUC-components if it included a bracket.
20100221

Updated: Mods and translations are altered to fit V8.3.
20100313
Added: Delete unused files from override
Fixed: Avoid looping under certain update-conditions. Calculate button-positions in the message screen to work with changed GUI-sizes. MsgBox-icons don't produce strange overlay-effects any more.
Changed: Mods are now shown as names and not as setups in both the mod and component admin.
Added: Language GUI to select the translations and set their priorities. Checks before leaving the folder-selection-screen. Rebuild the available mods in the selection screen if needed.
Added: Enabled localized chapter-entries. Added special grouping-menu (for unsuited and fun-mods and others to come).
Changed: Updated removal of BGT-dependent-mods since chapters were removed. Also updated removal of language-dependent-mods (TP, Abra...).
Added: Function to remove components from selection.
Fixed: Issues with variable that stores mods languages. Non-functioning of language-listing in mod-language-selection-screen. Prevent crashes if autosolve fails. Hints are shown after language-selection.
20100314
Added: Enable pauses during downloads and extractions. Show info while unpacking infinityanimations. String -- can bypass the mod-language. It's number will determine which translation will be used (default is English).
20100315
Fixed: Clicking outside of the context-menu on the advanced screen would cause you to jump to the next part of a mod. Pressing ESC would close a screen.
Added: Ask if users want to really exit selection-screen. Better response if link- and program-updates fail.
20100316
Fixed: Subcomponents were not reloaded due to a not valid RegExp-string. Some selections from the MUC/SUB-selections. Rightclicks on the context-menu of the dependency-screen are recognized. Actions were often badly interpreted.
Added: Hints when you click SUB/MUC/MOD that does not have a predefined selection. Enable removal of all mods that have open dependencies.
Updated: Rewritten conflicts and dependencies-help.
20100320
Added: Version-entries are stripped for component-entries when using Tra_GUI. Several little improvements in this GUI.
Changed: Dependencies and conflicts are solved during the creation of the GUI, so all conflicts and missing mods will be "selfmade".
Fixed: Changing directories failed if repeated two times while last time was visible. Setting pauses works again.
20100401
Fixed: Better detection of (not) failed extractions. Check before removing BG1TP's TP2-file. Enable proper reloading of fixed MUC and SUB-items. Downloads work with 0-byte URLs again. _Process_SetConsoleLog will translate vertical lines into @CRLF (carriage return line feed).
Changed: Set disabled to 0 instead of 4 in the Setup.ini [Order]-section to be more convenient.
Updated: Mods and translations are altered to fit V9.0.
20100402
Added: Optional pause after finishing download/extraction. Holding shift while clicking a mod will apply the selection to all parts if the mod is scattered. Adjusted installation for group-installations (hammers).
Fixed: Display a note when dependencies are not solvable due to the selected translations. Avoid crashes after selection new mod-translations (e.g. EN > EN SP). Avoid foreign fixed mods in selection after using reloads.
20100420
Updated: Order/mods/translation should fit with most parts of the installpack v9.0.2.
Changed: Do a full backup except data and unmodded folders like CDX. Altered restore to fit with that. Delete new bifs based on a file-list. Check if they are present. Don't remove current downloads, backups, portraits or BWS-related data.
Added: Create some tp2-dummy-entries with version-entries of weidu and the BWP-packages.
20100502
Fixed: Exclude files from backup process. Sorting in the component-administration-screen. Don't write double BWP-entries into weidu.log. Close NSIS-Setups by process and not by it's window. Cry for help if NSIS-processes are running.
Updated: File structures for improved readability. Order/mods/translations should fit with most parts of the BWP v9.1
Added: Close all weidu-instances before installation. Do another update-check. Added feedback after missing downloads/tp2-files are found. Improved handling of downloading / selecting missing downloads.
20100530
Fixed: _Depend_ListUnsolved will not return dependencies for other components of the requested mod. Dependeny and conflict-checks will check for mods with several instances (splitted mods like item_rev,scs...). Don't show components if mod is already displayed.
Changed: Functions that have to acount splitted mods also use the new function build for splitted mods (jumping to next part (context-menu), shift-clicking a mod, removing a mod (dependency-screen). Rewritten _Depend_GetUnsolved, _Depend_ListUnsolved and _Depend_ListConflicts so all tests use the same data to avoid faults and keep up with new functions.
Added: Search, add and remove groups that can be defined in the setup.ini. Added warning for adding mods by chapters that do not fit.
20100602
Fixed: Some crashes when dependencies are tested. Change attrib of BiG World Clean-Up.bat. Add BW-version-numbers by running WeiDU, so the text will not vanish after first installations.
Added: Some more info for the FAQ. Look at Docs\FAQ.txt.
20100619
Fixed: Strip backslashes from download-names. Edited _Install_GetGUICompNumber to fetch correct component-number.
Updated: Search for ToB-patch also fetches PrivateBuild-number to improve the check for the patch-version. More info for the FAQ.
Added: Install components in batches to avoid problems/speed up the installation.
20100628
Added:Optionally set the codepage ACP to 1252 (Western Europe) to avoid problems with non-unicode-programs. Handle mods that use prompts.tra (slightly modify these files to preserve English default tokens). Optionally play ring-sound if installation is halted (displays some questions).
Fixed: Bad logical error in batch/group-installation. Files with multiple attributes don't get messes up during backup/restore. Removed stupid scrolling issues in console-mode (e.g. Au3ExTest).
Changed: Put pre- and post-installation-checks into separate functions to improve readability and avoid errors. Changed how groups are handled. Remove CDCreAni.bif and DESound.bif from bif-checks after backup-restore because they seem to be additional files. Install those dummy-info-entries after WeiDU-replacements. Use quick-log to speed up installation.
20100704
Fixed: Added a few more checks for pending backslashes in pathnames (remove it for checks after changing the path and add one for detecting 25movies.bif).
Changed: Compressed all executables with upx. Set GUI and TrayIcon if BiG World Setup is launched by local installed version of AutoIt3.exe. Show old > new name of the downloads name during link-tests (the check if files are available).
Added: Use a second section in the user.ini to save deselected components of a mod. Useful to save deselected but fixed items. Also used to mark and search new components.
20100705
Fixed: New checks for pending backslashes
20100707
Added: Remove temporary download-folder (which is created right before the first start) if another folder is selected.
Fixed: BWS can handle installations in folders that contain other than standard-AscII-characters. (cd, wget and 7z receive not standard windows but the "crippled" DOS-characters by reading echoed strings from temp-files -- ugly but fast)
Changed: Faq written in html-format now. Other documents may follow. Packaged with winrar to have a nicer appearance and more place for some sort of introduction.
20100711
Fixed: Create empty mappings-file after the removal of the final bws-fake-entry so WeiDU can do changelogs.
Updated: Use English WinRAR-SFX-module.
20100827
Fixed: Pressing the exit-button while in console-window will work again while a question is displayed. Reload-function does not display hints about new items while resuming. Load additional language-specific-packages for a mod in the selected language (e.g. English GUI + preferred French Mod results will load French addon-packages if available.). Search correct file for extraction-logic (wait for BWS own NSIS-MsgBox).
Added: Skip one/all missing files if providing the files was set during Au3NetTest. Another check on the headers content-type to determine broken links (no files but websites are fetched).
Changed: Decreased response-time during questions in console-window.
20100831
Fixed: Link-test gets recognized in advanced mode. Stop fetching headers every time when fetching linkupdates for a single broken link.
Added: More verbose logging (only written to logfile, not displayed) during net-updates/downloads and extraction. BWS can now patch files, does updates with stripped ini-files and is able to deletes files/sections/keys.
20100908
Fixed: Possible crash when trying to update links manually. File-patching does not delete old content and creates a backup. Uncommented program-update. Avoid loops after update. Adjusted cleaning of override since it deleted some mod-files if no biffing is done (removed z#misc.*,dw#*,ION*,IOUNX*).
20101010
Fixed: Export selection to new format (use save/desave). Loading both old and new formated export-selections work as expected. Corrected language-depended prefixes. Set state for "TextHarmonisierung" every time the GUITreeView is build. Hide the "fix non-unicode-button" if you decide to continue (going back had overlayed GUI-elements). Fixed a crash during updates if new sections are added to ini-files.
Changed: Use first selection for mod-translations to determine which mods should be purged. Same goes for installation a few other mods (Textpatch).
Added: First included selection from a user (created by using the export-function), namely "Arkenors quest-selection". Widescreens treeviewitem (selection) and its checkbox (installopts) get synced.
20101103
Fixed: Don't use Winhttp on fastshare.org to prevent lags and failed connections. Use updated wget on ftp-files (replaces AutoIt-function) to get better results without temporary files. Crashes during reloads.
Added: Added "chapter trees" into the mod-selection-tree to improve visibility. Modified AI to fit with new chapter-trees. Added click-behavior to new trees (borrowed from add/remove menus). Conversion from install to new selection view if GUI may be shown. Download may be skipped. Note about not patching BG1-SAGA-Box.
Changed: Using a variable for the "component-replacement-holder" speeds up the building of the GUI => 500 ms.  Speed up startup by using StringRegExp to fetch setups and their names => 740 and 500 ms. Speed up while building the treeview by not searching component-descriptions (there aren't any) => 500 ms; using a variable instead of loading the value every time speeds up fetching item-connections => 180 ms. Translation-tokens are displayed in the treeview to see through faster.
20101108
Fixed: No more crashes during startup caused by select.txt. Selecting mods of the same theme works as it should using menu and treeview-items. If a "special" search is done, hits are expanded properly. If old hits are reseted, those aren't expanded any more. Don't fetch false defaults during first first build or language-change.
Added: Append an asterisk to the label if mod is splitted (for better visibility).
Changed: Dropped Spanish and French translations because second was a template and the first needs a lot of work. (No disrespect to the translators. I just asked when they wanted to do their work and we agreed that they'll do it when it's close to a release some time ago. I think it'll be included then.)
20101114
Changed: values of linkupdates are treated case-sensitive now, so a is not A any more.
20101129
Updated: Some mods conflicts and dependencies, components and translations.
20101130
Fixed: Don't append lines at the end of files while applying patches, which causes crashes if Select.txt is patched.
20101212
Fixed: Adjusted _Tree_Purge to prevent the installation of purged foreign mods.
Added: You can choose if you want to use the new category or the old pdf-like view. Mods that are not adding text but aren't translated either are shown as [--].
20101213
Fixed: Stupid miss while changing parameters
20101219
Fixed: Possible extraction of all mods into BG1-folder
20101226
Changed: Slightly altered the methods to fetch filenames from http-headers to match forum-free.net.
20110115
Added: Import your selection from a WeiDU.log
20110116
Fixed: Removed dependency that might crash the BWS (thanks to Chevalier).
Added: Create Logs\BWS_Tracedump.txt before Debug.au3 tries to fix things to track down some unknown errors.
20110303
Changed: Moved version number to the informations that are shown when clicking on a mod.
20110304
Fixed: Possible crash due to scsII increasing number of components. WeiDU.exe will be put into BG2-dir if it does not exist.
20110316
Fixed: Skipping download will really skip the link-check and the download (test and fix will still be done). Additonal check for missing downloads works again. Don't use passive ftp (so downloads don't get stuck due to your firewall).
Added: If downloads are missing and you redo the download-process, downloads that are ok will be skipped. Fix for CTB-packaging.
20110404
Fixed: Automatic display of mods tips/data. Removed double entry from BGTNEJ. BG1TP looks for correct version. Exiting component-screen when using [CTRL]+[Alt]+[c] now works as expected. _Tra_GetVersion accepts quotation marks.
Changed: Access the mod-selection through the folder-page. Moved some tests from the tools-page. Ask for updates every time the BWS starts. Updated help to fit new layout
Removed: Quickstart-mode. Tools-page.
Added: Selection between batch/bws-installation. Components are not show when installing batch-version. Dis-/Enabled various GUI-options when using BWS/BWP installation. If checks are ok, give batch the key-files it searches for. Improved handling of BiG World Install.bat (use temp-files if necessary). Added [Ctrl]+[E] hotkey in component screen to switch detected component descriptions to stored English description (useful for Korean, Japanese, Chinese or Russian if symbols cannot be displayed due to codepage).
20110405
Fixed: Some download issues, replace Wget.exe with a fresh one from the net, exit on event mode after inet-update.
Changed: Don't use debug mode as default.
20110406
Added: Show sorting-state in options-menu.
Fixed: Crash when switching between pdf- and theme-sorting.
Removed: "Hover over treeview-item to select it" code.
20110410
Fixed: Theme-checkboxes should behave as expected after loading an old selection/preselection. Deny any change of any checkbox while AI is working to prevent errors. Get output from weidu in administration-sections. Have wget-checks work properly again.
Added: Check for infinityanimations-files that begin with non-standard ascii charakters. Copy some files for cleanup.bat. Added usage of referers to download from some strict servers.
20110501
Fixed: Don't show items that would have conflicts / open dependencies with components that are not available due to language-selection.
20120322
Added: BG1-installation for french corrections. Wiki-links for German users. Improved install-conditions to determine if eg. hotfixes are used, NEJ2 is installed. Improved wgetsize/_Net_LinkGetInfo.
Changed: Use csv- and not prn-style for select.txt
Removed: Winhttp/http methods to get names and filesizes from urls since they caused kind of random errors.
20120327
Fixed: Ignore categories when saving selections. Reload BWS in correct appmode so dependencies work. Corrected detection of splitted mods (which was not precise). Only look for CMD-options if csv-line contains enough separators. Removed "always ok"-condition for fixed mods in TP2-checks (so BGT gets moved out of the subfolder).
Added: Support up to 5 parallel downloads. Enable resume if past logged and current state are the same. Enable pause/resume and close when doing downloads. Don't check downloads again if check was logged before. Disable pause if resume not supported.
Changed: Adjusted group-install preparations to new csv-format.
20120401
Changed: Some more minor adaptions to CSV. Adlib-functions to do progessbar-updates during downloads more frequently. Adjusted help-text for download. Made bws- first, batch-install second option. Moved external preselections (Kerzenburg) in front of classic selections. Made "Total happiness" the default option. Loading an externalized selection at boot-time and in the pre-selection-screen does not overwrite your previous selection any more; otherwise a restart of the BWS would cause a loss of your selection.
Fixed: Typo that could cause downloads to loop infinitely. Typo that displayed the message at the end of the install when skipping cmd-lines.
Added: Copy patch for fft after extraction. Enable Exit/Pause/Resume during download-stage, so you can work on all downloads at once. Added a few checks to prevent installation-errors caused by cmd not reacting to STDInWrite.
20120407
Removed: Program-updates + patching since it will not be used.
Changed: Adjusted Link-Updates to fit with new Mod.ini (which is automatically created). If you do an update, further requests to do so and manual updates are suppressed. When solving dependencies and conflicts, the description is now displayed in two lines.
Added: If you did not save your mods selection before, resolution is checked to enable/disable widescreen by default. Progress is shown for solving conflicts and dependencies after switching to a BWP versions.
Fixed: Download-buttons don't overlap the other text any more. Altered RegExp for _Install_ReadWeiDU/Installation-check so UB X will not be mistaken for BG1UB X.
20120413
Fixed: Download-progress is shown on Win7 systems. Detect broken links or 0 byte-files during download. Don't wait infinitely for wgets spider-mode. Execute NSIS-packages on Win7 systems. Corrected testing if InfinityAnimation\content-folder contains files with ANSI. Only extract IA-content-packages that are selected. _Process_ChangeDir checks for original and via _StringVerifyAscII converted path. Fixed extraction-problem if BWS's path contains extended ASCII.
Changed: Increased progress-updates during download to 1000 ms. Decompressed tools because Norton thinks wget is fishy. Virustotal thinks it's ok.
Added: Fallback-option to wgets spider-mode (using inetget).
20120422
Fixed: Corrected "fictional" WeiDU-version-entries for BWS and WeiDU. Reload-functions for saves didn't import correctly (reporting false news). Edited conditions for GOG backup-restoration. Switching to pdf had wrong sorting.
Changed: Use group-install per default.
20120620
Updated: Rewritten the descriptions for extraction-test, click-properties, download-failures and actions to fix them. Added a note that you can restart by clicking the VBS.
Added: Mark downloads that have to be downloaded manually in _Net_ListMissing. User can test for archive-integrity if extraction failed. Also made download option available at that point. List of URLs that are used to fetch the files for your current selection. May be useful if you want to use your own download-manager. WGET-process can be viewed/controlled by clicking on a slot in the download-manager. Stalled downloads are marked red. Russian translation is available (thanks to prowler and arcanecoast.ru).
Changed: Put errors with Infinity-extraction into Faults-section. Remove TP2 or testfiles while running Au3ExFix if there were errors during extraction. If tests are passed later, the user would have done the extraction correctly. Put question and answer from _Process_Question into the logfile. NSIS-extractions are listed as failed until the TP2 is found in the NSIS-extraction-folder. Gamers selections from BWS-section are not displayed in batch-mode since they don't fit there (as batch-mode selection would be too "bulky", e.g. only install Ascension from BigPicture would be impossible without editing). Moved preselection and mod-descriptions into separate file.
Fixed: Don't delete faults during extractions when finishing Au3ExFix (since Fix is not the last step during extraction!). Save current state when switching from mod to install-sorting-view without overwriting the last save. Expand array while parsing a Debug-file (in case mod installs more than 99 items). Explain why BWS exits if it has no write-permission to create fake-tp2-files in BG2-folder (to document used BWP/BWS-versions) and tell user how to start as an administrator. Remove connection-strings that need a BWS-install if batch-install-method is used. No more overlapping language/install-type - boxes after treeview-rebuilding. Corrected selection-states for chapter-icons. Purge MUC-subtree when subitems are deleted. Fixed possible-components-per-mod-counter. Fixed mod-counter for reload. Prevent entering false LANG-tokens for component-detection. Prevent crash when changing languages.
20120623
Fixed: Display Russian mod-descriptions. Copy fitting strings-file for BiG World Clean-Up.
20120701
Fixed: Don't remove files if extraction failed and strings for testing are not defined [Au3ExFix]. Corrected detection of the fault-type [_Extract_ListMissing].
Changed: Moved error-detection and file-deletion to the fixing [Au3ExFix].
Added: TP2-file can be "extracted" now (it will overwrite an existing one) [_Extract_CheckMod].
20120903
Changed: Testing mediafire-links will also return the "interaction is needed"-notifier. [_Net_LinkTest] Building of component-list is moved back so users can select their settings/language and then the GUI is build. [Au3Select, _Tree_Populate, _Misc_ReBuildTreeView] Use _Tree_SetPreSelected for component GUI building (has better logic standard). [_Tree_Populate] Splitted/moved menu-creation into the (re)creation of the Treeview. [_Misc_CreateMenu], [_Tree_GetTags] If mods are missing during install, BWS will now ask what to do (instead of just running on). [Au3Install]
Fixed: Disable clicking a tab "through" the label at the top (strange effect). [Au3BuildGUI] Contextmenu does not loop anymore when opening URLs and jumping to next part of a mod. [_Selection_ContextMenu] Improved detection of prompt-files and commenting important keywords; works with DSotSC again. [_Install_SetPrompt]
Removed: Functions that remove treeview items -- it just messes up the GUIs recognition (like moving to next items of a mod). [_Selection_RemoveBG1], [_Tree_Purge], [_Tree_PurgeItem], [_Tree_PurgeForeign]
Added: Better recognition for need to rebuild the component-GUI. Use when entering that screen or leaving the folder-selection. [_Tree_Populate_PreCheck] New function to detect items that have to be removed. Also used for InfinityAnimations. RegEx is used to skip those items when reading the Select.txt. [_Tree_PurgeUnNeeded], [_Test_ACP] Added another option that pauses the install if components are skipped. [_Install_TestInstalled]
20120904
Fixed: Downloading link-updates that already existed resulted in an error. [_Net_Update_Link] If first setups in a "theme" were not created, all with the same went missing. [_Tree_Populate]
20120907
Fixed: Avoid crashes on reinstall when checking non-component-lines and made check a bit more accurate. Try to avoid a halt on setup-errors using WeiDUs --no-exit-pause. [Au3Install]
Changed: Move faulty "check-files" (TP2 or others) rather than delete them (may be useful for debugging). [Au3ExFix]
20120929
Added: Add or remove German BG1NPC part-translation depending on lanuage-selection. [_Tree_PurgeUnNeeded]
20121017
Fixed: German translation issue stalled the BWS when responding to a question. [Au3TestExtract] Accept Cyrillic codepage for IA-installs. [_Test_ACP]
20121202
Added: Some more non-std-ascii translations for reading weidu [_StringVerifyExtAscII]. Debugging-function to get dos-character-codes. [_Tra_Gui]
Removed: Fix for fft. [Au3ExFix]
20121216
Fixed: Answering questions returns lowered characters and answer now has to be a single letter. [_Process_Question] Moved deletion of GUIControls so editing the mods language-selections and thereafter loading a PreSelectionXX.ini does not result in a crash. [_Misc_LS_Verify] Moving save-games during restoring should not fail anymore. [_Backup_Restore]
Removed: Since BGT does handle the missing sounds-issue since v1.15, the not used code-pieces have been removed. [_Test_CheckRequieredFiles_BG1Patch]
20130212
Added: Handle IWD1+II and PST. [*] Automatic detection of IWDI+II and PST-games. [Au3Detect] Testing for IWDI+II and PST-version. [_Test_CheckRequieredFiles_IWD1/IWD2/PST]. Put slidely improved/compacted folder-detection into own function. [_Test_GetGamePath] Added menus, context-menus and accelerators for better usage in mod-administration. [_Admin_ModGui], [_Tra_Gui] Use them to either open or test urls, files, sizes, tests. [_Admin_ItemOpen],[_Admin_ItemTest] Test URLs, filenames and sizes and optionally adjust values to the given result. [_Admin_ItemTest] Improved testing before saving. [_Admin_ModSave] Added editor to manage the installation-order with menus, accels, testing before saving entries and move/add/delete/edit/cut/paste entries. [_Select_*] (Re)added editor to manage dependencies with menus, accels, tests and so on. [Dep_*] Rewritten GUI creation to fit to different games. Added translations/hints for those games.
Changed: Moved configuration-files, lots of changed variables to keep up with that. [*] Previous folder-selections are the initial directory for browsing somewhere else. [Au3Select] Redesigned the mod-administration. [_Admin_Mod*], [_Admin_Item*], [Au3BuildGUI] Don't only display the mods name but also the setups name when fetching translations (seems more convinient). Use same method to edit-items. [_Tra_Gui]
20130222
Fixed: Changed names so keywords don't get translated 2 times and thus get irritating. Added IWD2-test. [Translation] Selecting a mod without read components will not crash when managing sequences. [_Select_ItemEdit] Delete old names/setups from comboboxes when reentering admin-screens. [_Admin_Populate] Entries that init a choice don't get messed up on save. [_Select_ItemEditSave] Don't crash when translation number for no-text is wrong. [_GetTra] Adjusted number of chapters so BWS does not crash on BWP-load not reloads. [_Tree_Populate] Show tips at startup. Show other tips when changing games. [Au3Select, _Misc_SetWelcomeScreen, _Misc_SetTip]
Added: When adding or deleting mod in the screen to manage mods, those get added or removed in the comboboxes of this and the other management screens. [__Admin_ModSave/Delete] Repair IDS-entries during install of BWP-installs. Make IDS batches usable for usage without install.bat. [Au3RunFix, _Install_RepairIDS]
Updated: Russian translation (thanks to silent/quiet).
20130303
Addded: Enabled renaming of setups when managing mods. Run tests before renaming or overwriting mods/setups. [_Admin_ModSave] Additional messages if debug-file can't be read (reported on Windows 8). [_Install_TestInstalled] Test if patching works before starting install  (reported on Windows 7/8). [_Install_PatchTest]
Fixed: Still check for Mod.ini when downloading the update-package was done before. [_Net_Update_Link] Fixed endless looping when searching non-existent tokens in management screens. [_Select_Search] Extract UpdateIni if download of update-package proceeded before but ini did not get extracted. [_Net_Update_Link] Don't ask about BG1NPC on restart if you do a German install.
20130304
Fixed: Define values of setups / directories before updating or switching back/forth on welcome-screens. [_Misc_SetWelcomeScreen], [Au3Select]

20161103 - Updated by agb1
 A. if you restart BWS and abort an EET installion before it finished the BG1 portion, it will return you to the BG2:EE/EET game tab (previously, it took you to the BG1:EE game tab)
 B. for EET, the BiG World Fixpack will be correctly extracted and run in the BG1:EE folder before installing any mods
 C. the BWS install debug log will show more of the command-line actions it runs (disabled some log suppression code)
 D. updated ini files for:  k9RoughWorld (missing linefeeds), Fishing for Trouble (v3.1 -> v3.1.2), Dark Side of the Sword Coast (added link to EET version by K4thos; still points to old version for BGT), drizzt saga (cosmetic - description now correctly indicates EET support), de'Arnise Romance (v4 -> v5, added French translation), Skip Chateau Irenicus (removed invalid line breaks in description), EET patches for BG2EE mods (marked as 'fixed' / mandatory for EET installs)
 E. added TDDz installer for TDD on EE games; enabled TDDz and original TDD (set to download-only, required by TDDz for some assets) in BG2EE/EET selection; added dependency; added TDD to ExtractOnly list in BG2EE\Game.ini only (should not be in BWP\Game.ini)
 F. enabled Wild Mage Additions, Fading Promises, Lure of the SIrine's Call, and Alternatives for BG2EE/EET games
 G. modified purge rules for DSotSC to reflect that it now works with EET; meanwhile, the other BGEE version of DSotSC is NOT compatible with EET; also adjusted BGT dependency rules for NToTSC to account for DSotSC availability in EET without NToTSC
 H. adjusted worldmap dependency rules for TDD, TDDz, DSotSC
 I. added EET conflict rules to block selection of Stone of Askavar BP-BGT-Worldmap variant, Drizzt Saga BP-BGT-Worldmap variant; only the default variants with area triggers are available for selection now in EET installs
 J. removed unsupported old pre-EET BGEE graphics overhaul mod from selection for EET (new EET-compatible version of the mod is still available, but marked expert due to reported graphical glitches)
 K. moved some EET-compatible mods after EET install to conform to requirements:  DSotSC & TDDz & Lure of the Sirine's Call (newly available for EET), The Grey Clan, BG Travel (new travel system for BG1 city), and Thalantyr store extra items mod
 L. moved textpack / translation mods other than Polish (which was already there) before EET install; added a special ANN;EET; marker line before them so they get installed in the BG2:EE folder even though they come before EET in BG2EE\Select.txt
 M. moved Xulaye to NPCs category (was incorrectly listed with kit mods) for BG2EE/EET installs
 N. Irenicus dungeon skip mods not selected by default for BG2EE installs (due to risk of missing out on mod-added content there)
 O. cleaned up Klatu Fixes & Tweaks components for BG2EE/EET, marking 2060 and 2070 as expert due to deprecation & user reports and enabling several others by default
 P. switched aTweaks default selection from 115 to 117 (scrolls scribable only at inns/taverns instead of everywhere) to provide more incentive to visit inns
 Q. moved special case handling of EET patches for BG2EE mods and the BWS OverwriteFiles feature to the Au3Run step, which occurs after all extractions are complete (including user-prompted manual problem resolutions)
 R. removed some apparently(?) unnecessary 'always process Select.txt from the first line, just in case' logic that was causing EET installs to re-apply command-line actions from the BG1EE section when starting the BG2EE section
 S. fixed a couple of bugs related to the 'install components as a group' feature
 
20161106 - Updated by agb1 
 Dace NPC marked Expert for EE installs due to recent user reports; added BiG World Textpack, Trimpack and Smoothpack to the BG2EE installation process; more progress towards EET support.
 
20161114 - Updated by agb1
 Attempted to fix Update If Needed script, which wasn't working for me again

20161129 - Updated by agb1
 Use 1.5 BG2EE version of Alora for BG2:SoA too - no content difference, and the BiG World Fixpack patch restores German non-UTF8 tra files (Russian is probably still borked)
 Also, SCS component 4110 (NPC pairs can separate) is now patched by the BiG World Fixpack so it can be installed on EET (untested in game, but verified install without errors)
 
20161130 - Updated by agb1
 Disabled generalized biffing for Enhanced Edition installs

20170619 - Updated by argent77
 Added PSTEE support.
